In the 5G and beyond era, multipath transport protocols, including MPQUIC, are necessary in various use cases. In MPQUIC, one of the most critical issues is efficiently scheduling the upcoming transmission packets on several paths considering path dynamicity. To this end, this paper introduces FQ-SAT - a novel Fuzzy Q-learning-based MPQUIC scheduler for data transmission optimization, including download time, in heterogeneous wireless networks.

#### In summary, the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows:

<ul>
    <li>We propose a new scheduler for MPQUIC, named FQ-SAT. FQ-SAT leverages Q-learning to facilitate the simultaneous evolution of the agent and the network environment to control the scheduling process effectively. FQ-SAT also uses a fuzzy logic system to choose a suitable learning rate at each time of updating the Q-value to mitigate the impact of high network dynamicity.</li>
    <li>We have implemented the proposed FQ-SAT scheduler using quic-go.</li>
    <li>We have extensively investigated FQ-SAT performance under the variation of hyperparameters. Moreover, we have compared FQ-SAT to other schedulers in a network emulator and an actual deployment. The results show that FQ-SAT reduces single-file download time by 3.2%â€“13.8%, speeds web page downloading up to 20.4%, and reaches percentage of on-time segments up to 97.5% in video streaming, compared to the others, proving the remarkable ability of FQ-SAT to handle the dynamic heterogeneous network.</li>
</ul>
