  abstract={In the era of 5G and beyond, mobile devices usually can access several heterogeneous wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi and 5G). To simultaneously and efficiently utilize the accessible network resources, muli path transport protocols, such as MPTCP and MPQUIC, have shown much potential. In these protocols, scheduling is one of the critical processes to ensure the performance of the multipath transmission. Although there have been many proposed multipath schedulers in the literature, they have not performed well in heterogeneous networks, especially when the network conditions vary (i.e., dynamicity). In this paper, we propose a novel Q-learning-based Multipath scheduler for data transmission optimization (Q-SAT), aiming to bypass the existing limitation. By leveraging the self-learning ability of reinforcement learning, Q-SAT can instantly observe environmental changes and deploy appropriate path selection to optimize data transmission time. As a result, Q-SAT efficiently schedules multipath communication in heterogeneous wireless networks with different dynamicity levels. We have implemented Q-SAT with MPQUIC and extensively evaluated Q-SAT in an emulated environment and a real network. The evaluation results show that Q-SAT improves the data transmission time by at least 10% in the emulation and 26% in the actual deployment compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
